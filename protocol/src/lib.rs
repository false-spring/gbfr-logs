/*!
This library crate provides the event protocol that is emitted by the "hook"
injected into the game process and consumed by the GBFR Logs parser.

Keep in mind that the serialization protocol is not defined here, only the
serializable message types.

The protocol between the hook and the parser is a simple named pipe, where the
messages are encoded as "bincode" serialized bytes. This means that the hook and
the parser must be compiled together to ensure that the serialization format is
the same.

The parser saves these messages in a different serialization format that provides
forward-compatibility so that old logs can still be read by newer versions of the
parser.

Because of this, any changes to the protocol must be done carefully to ensure that
the parser can still read old logs. This is done by adding new fields to the existing
message types, or adding new message types that are ignored by the parser
